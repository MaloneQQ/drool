# drool

It is said that the source of a markdown is so easy to be read, so why not show it directly on a page without compling it? Based on this consideration, I designed a kind of LML named *drool*. You can show images, videos, audios and links with it. Also you can align something right and retract something smartly with it, but cannot make something bold or italic, which is why drool is different from markdown. Compared with markdown, drool is minimal without signals like `[` or `!`. Drool will not make a literary article look like programming codes.

See more on [a demo](https://dou4cc.github.io/drool/demo.en.html) which requires supports on async function, WebP, WebM, fetch API, CSS variable, sticky position, and full of ECMAScript 6. I recommend you use Chromium or Chrome Canary with the proper flags on. I was sorry to use a lot of unstable features and not to give the project a version. If you are unable to open the demo, you can refer to [the screenshot](https://dou4cc.github.io/drool/screenshot.en.png).

There is a BOM in the head of every text file and I use `\r\n` rather than `\n` to break lines because I use Windows.
