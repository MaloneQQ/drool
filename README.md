# drool

It is said that the source of a markdown is so simple to understand, so why not show it directly on a page without compling it? Based on this thought, I design a kind of LML named *drool* which can show images, videos, audios and links. You can also align something right and retract something smartly with it, but cannot make something bold or italic. See more on the [demo](https://dou4cc.github.io/drool/demo.en.html).
